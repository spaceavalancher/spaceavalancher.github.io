## Current PhD's students



**Lorrain Delaroque** [started in Oct. 2024] uses numerical simulations to explore how seismic body waves can reveal the structure of Titan’s icy crust. Her work supports the upcoming Dragonfly mission, which will send a drone across Titan’s enigmatic equatorial dunes and crater shape landscape. 

**Yassine Boukhari** [started in oct. 2022] explores the dynamics of sediment transfer (mainly mass wastings) in highly erosive Alpine catchments. Using time-series LiDAR data and long-term observatory records, his research aims to untangle how geomorphic processes shape—and are shaped by—a rapidly evolving mountain landscape.


**Coline Hopkin** [started in oct. 2022] investigates slow-moving landslides in tropical settings, combining InSAR, photogrammetry, and geological analysis. Her research focuses on how climate-driven processes influence sediment supply to rivers, with a particular focus on the lush and dynamic landscapes of Réunion Island.
