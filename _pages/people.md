## Current PhD's students



**Lorrain Delaroque** [started in Oct. 2024] 
uses numerical simulations to explore how seismic body waves can reveal the structure of Titan’s icy crust. Her work supports the upcoming Dragonfly mission, which will send a drone across Titan’s enigmatic equatorial dunes and crater shape landscape. 

**Yassine Boukhari** [started in oct. 2022] 
explores the dynamics of sediment transfer (mainly mass wastings) in highly erosive Alpine catchments. Using time-series LiDAR data and long-term observatory records, his research aims to untangle how geomorphic processes shape—and are shaped by—a rapidly evolving mountain landscape.


**Coline Hopkin** [started in oct. 2022] 
investigates slow-moving landslides in tropical settings, combining InSAR, photogrammetry, and geological analysis. Her research focuses on how climate-driven processes influence sediment supply to rivers, with a particular focus on the lush and dynamic landscapes of Réunion Island.



## Current Interns


**Grégoire Vest**
\[Final-year engineering project, AI & Imagery, EPITA]  
explores how physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be used with SAR data to infer surface properties. Applications to snow avalanche detection are currently under investigation.

**Marceau Cottrez**
\[Final-year engineering project, AI & Imagery, EPITA]   
uses AI techniques on 3D point clouds from ground-based LiDAR to extract vegetation structures and estimate biomass in complex terrains.

**Valentine Hoscoet**
\[1st year MSc in Natural Hazards, IPGP]  
applies scattering networks to classify seismic signals from debris, rock, and snow avalanches, with the goal of improving detection and characterization.

**Thibault Chardon**
\[1st year MSc in Natural Hazards, IPGP]  
develops machine learning algorithms to detect snow avalanches in medium-resolution SAR imagery, addressing the challenge of high speckle noise.

**Milan Mauro**
\[1st year MSc in Computer Science, Université Savoie Mont Blanc]  
analyzes NASA’s InSight seismic data using scattering networks to classify events recorded throughout the Martian mission.

**Lisa Corzani**
\[1st year MSc in Planetary Sciences, PSL]  
maps rockfalls at NASA’s FSS lunar landing site to estimate mass wasting activity expected during the mission timeline.

**Marta Ducamp**
\[2nd-year engineering student in Geomatics & Photogrammetry]  
re-examines Apollo mission imagery to quantify lunar surface roughness across spatial scales.
