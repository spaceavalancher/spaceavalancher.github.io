I am co-supervising PhD students and graduates at IPGP across a range of research themes, including seismic signal classification, SAR-based and LiDAR monitoring of geomorphic processes, landslides and avalanches, sediment transport dynamics, and the modeling of surface evolution on Earth and other planetary bodies. These projects combine remote sensing, numerical simulations, seismology, and machine learning techniques.

They contribute to tackling complex questions at the intersection of geomorphology, geophysics, remote sensing, and planetary science, with a strong emphasis on:

* **Earth surface dynamics** (mass wasting, sediment transport, landslides, avalanches),
* **Planetary surfaces** (Titan, Moon, Mars) and mission-driven science (e.g., *Dragonfly*, *InSight*, *FSS*, *Cassini*, *Apollo*),
* **Advanced methods** such as InSAR, LiDAR, seismic scattering, and machine learning (PINNs, detection algorithms, clustering).  


This is where applied field science meets computational geoscience and mission-oriented planetary studies. The research is both ambitious and strategic, especially as Earth and planetary processes become increasingly interlinked in modern geosciences.


## Current PhD Students

**Lorrain Delaroque** \[Started in Oct. 2024]
uses numerical simulations to explore how seismic body waves can reveal the structure of Titan’s icy crust. Her work supports the upcoming *Dragonfly* mission, which will send a drone across Titan’s enigmatic equatorial dunes and cratered landscapes.

**Yassine Boukhari** \[Started in Oct. 2022]
explores the dynamics of sediment transfer—primarily mass wasting—in highly erosive Alpine catchments. Using time-series LiDAR data and long-term observatory records, his research aims to untangle how geomorphic processes shape, and are shaped by, a rapidly evolving mountain landscape.

**Coline Hopkin** \[Started in Oct. 2022]
investigates slow-moving landslides in tropical environments, combining InSAR, photogrammetry, and geological analysis. Her research focuses on how climate-driven processes influence sediment supply to rivers, particularly in the dynamic landscapes of Réunion Island.



## Current Interns

**Grégoire Vest**
*Final-year engineering project, AI & Imagery, EPITA*  
explores how physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be used with SAR data to infer surface properties. Applications to snow avalanche detection are currently under investigation.

**Marceau Cottrez**
*Final-year engineering project, AI & Imagery, EPITA*  
uses AI techniques on 3D point clouds from ground-based LiDAR to extract vegetation structure and estimate biomass in complex terrains.

**Valentine Hoscoet**
*1st year MSc in Natural Hazards, IPGP*  
applies scattering networks to classify seismic signals generated by debris, rock, and snow avalanches, with the aim of improving detection and characterization.

**Thibault Chardon**
*1st year MSc in Natural Hazards, IPGP*  
develops machine learning algorithms for detecting snow avalanches in medium-resolution SAR imagery, addressing the challenges posed by speckle noise.

**Milan Mauro**
*1st year MSc in Computer Science, Université Savoie Mont Blanc*  
analyzes NASA’s InSight seismic data using scattering networks to classify seismic events recorded throughout the Martian mission.

**Lisa Corzani**
*1st year MSc in Planetary Sciences, PSL*  
maps rockfalls at NASA’s FSS lunar landing site to estimate the mass-wasting activity expected during the mission timeline.

**Marta Ducamp**
*2nd-year engineering student in Geomatics & Photogrammetry, ENSG-IGN*  
re-examines Apollo mission imagery to quantify lunar surface roughness across spatial scales.
