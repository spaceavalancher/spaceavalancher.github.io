I am co-supervising PhD students and graduates at IPGP across a range of research themes, including seismic signal classification, SAR-based and LiDAR monitoring of geomorphic processes, landslides and avalanches, sediment transport dynamics, and the modeling of surface evolution on Earth and other planetary bodies. These projects combine remote sensing, numerical simulations, seismology, and machine learning techniques.

They contribute to tackling complex questions at the intersection of geomorphology, geophysics, remote sensing, and planetary science, with a strong emphasis on:

* **Earth surface dynamics** (mass wasting, sediment transport, landslides, avalanches),
* **Planetary surfaces** (Titan, Moon, Mars) and mission-driven science (e.g., *Dragonfly*, *InSight*, *FSS*, *Cassini*, *Apollo*),
* **Advanced methods** such as InSAR, LiDAR, seismic scattering, and machine learning (PINNs, detection algorithms, clustering).  


This is where applied field science meets computational geoscience and mission-oriented planetary studies. The research is both ambitious and strategic, especially as Earth and planetary processes become increasingly interlinked in modern geosciences.


## Current PhD Students

## Post-doctoral researchers

**2020–2022 — Léa Bonnefoy**
*Post-doctoral researcher (50 % supervision)*
CNES-funded post-doc from November 2020 to November 2021, followed by a second year in partnership with Cornell University (2022).
Under my scientific supervision, Léa investigated the dielectric properties of the planned *Dragonfly* landing site, which will probe Titan’s critical zone in 2036.
The project resulted in multiple international conference presentations and one peer-reviewed publication.
Léa is now completing her post-doctoral research at LMD, Sorbonne Université.

**2021 — Shen Liang**
*Post-doctoral researcher (100 % supervision, DiiP–funded PARKKER project, PI)*
In 2021, Shen and I developed the **FARMYARD** framework, which led to two peer-reviewed conference papers and a manuscript currently under revision for *IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering*.
Shen continues to work at DiiP on another project, and our collaboration remains active.


## Research engineer

Co-author of Michon *et al.* (2023, HAL) and three additional papers (one in review, two in preparation).
Matthieu now holds a permanent position at GeoAzur, after a period working in the industry sector.
