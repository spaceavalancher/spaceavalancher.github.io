I am co-supervising PhD students and graduates at IPGP across a range of research themes, including seismic signal classification, SAR-based and LiDAR monitoring of geomorphic processes, landslides and avalanches, sediment transport dynamics, and the modeling of surface evolution on Earth and other planetary bodies. These projects combine remote sensing, numerical simulations, seismology, and machine learning techniques.

They contribute to tackling complex questions at the intersection of geomorphology, geophysics, remote sensing, and planetary science, with a strong emphasis on:

* **Earth surface dynamics** (mass wasting, sediment transport, landslides, avalanches),
* **Planetary surfaces** (Titan, Moon, Mars) and mission-driven science (e.g., *Dragonfly*, *InSight*, *FSS*, *Cassini*, *Apollo*),
* **Advanced methods** such as InSAR, LiDAR, seismic scattering, and machine learning (PINNs, detection algorithms, clustering).  


This is where applied field science meets computational geoscience and mission-oriented planetary studies. The research is both ambitious and strategic, especially as Earth and planetary processes become increasingly interlinked in modern geosciences.


## Current PhD Students

**Lorrain Delaroque** \[Started in Oct. 2024]
uses numerical simulations to explore how seismic body waves can reveal the structure of Titan’s icy crust. Her work supports the upcoming *Dragonfly* mission, which will send a drone across Titan’s enigmatic equatorial dunes and cratered landscapes.

**Yassine Boukhari** \[Started in Oct. 2022]
explores the dynamics of sediment transfer—primarily mass wasting—in highly erosive Alpine catchments. Using time-series LiDAR data and long-term observatory records, his research aims to untangle how geomorphic processes shape, and are shaped by, a rapidly evolving mountain landscape.

## Current Interns

**Milan Mauro**
*1st year MSc in Computer Science, Université Savoie Mont Blanc*  
analyzes NASA’s InSight seismic data using scattering networks to classify seismic events recorded throughout the Martian mission.

**Marta Ducamp**
*2nd-year engineering student in Geomatics & Photogrammetry, ENSG-IGN*  
re-examines Apollo mission imagery to quantify lunar surface roughness across spatial scales.
