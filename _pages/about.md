### About me ###

My scientific research focuses on deciphering the interior structure and geologic evolution of the terrestrial planets and moons. As a geophysicist, I mostly use planetary topography, gravity, and magnetic field data that have been acquired from orbiting spacecraft, but I also rely on remote sensing data, seismic data, thermal evolution modeling, and impact crater formation models. I have worked with several lunar missions, including NASA's lunar gravity mapping mission *GRAIL* and the upcoming *Lunar Vertex* mission that will investigate one of the largest magnetic anomalies on the Moon. I am also a co-investigator on NASA's geophysical mission to Mars, *Insight*, the laser altimeter on ESA's *BepiColombo* mission to Mercury, the laser altimeter on the *JUICE* mission that will investigate the moons of Jupiter, and NASA's mission to the asteroid 16 *Psyche*.

I am currently at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, where I have been since 2023. Prior to this I was at the *Observatoire de la CÃ´te d'Azur* as a member of the *Laboratoire Lagrange* (2017-2022), and before this I was the leader of the Planetary and Space Sciences group at IPGP. I was the editor-in-chief of the *Journal of Geophysical Research Planets* from 2011-2015 and I am currently a member of the *Icarus* editorial advory board. In addition to my scientific activities, I am the lead developer of the [shtools](https://shtools.github.io/SHTOOLS/) software package that is used for analyzing global data expressed in spherical harmonics.
