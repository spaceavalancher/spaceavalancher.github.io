  abstract = {The granular materials—whether they descend slopes as avalanches of debris or rock, or are shaped by wind into vast sand seas—dominate many solid bodies within the Solar System. These processes that shape planetary surfaces serve as witnesses to forcing mechanisms.
The study presented condenses a decade of research on sediment mobility, conducted quantitatively and integrated with: (i) physical or phenomenological models along with numerical simulations of sediment transport; (ii) multi-wavelength remote sensing measurements supported by radiative modeling and photogrammetry. Applied to the dune fields of Titan, Mars, and Earth's deserts, these approaches demonstrate how aeolian conditions, sediment supply, and substrate texture (whether rocky or icy) influence the orientation and wavelength of dunes. They also quantify transitions between dust and sand that feed into planetary atmospheric cycles.
This framework offers a new perspective on slope instability phenomena such as landslides and debris avalanches. Analyzing the morphodynamic system through the Solar System reveals a common phenomenological framework, allowing observations, measurements, seismic recordings, and numerical modeling to be reconciled.
Finally, this approach retraces the mechanics of propagation and upstream-downstream coupling between slope instabilities (e.g., landslides, debris avalanches) and fluvial responses.
This work leads to numerous methodological and thematic insights. Notably, it seeks a better understanding of how changes in climatic conditions affect sediment transport over different time scales. For example, if it is demonstrated that permafrost degradation increases instability occurrences, the study also explores whether these instabilities' behavior is similarly impacted. This has implications for sediment availability, unaltered material availability, and carbon fluxes on Earth.
By linking granular physical processes with remote sensing and comparative planetary science, this work provides a coherent framework to interpret—and ultimately predict—geomorphological traces of climate change on Earth.}

  abstract = {On May 28, 2025, a massive rock-ice avalanche struck near Blatten (Lötschental Valley, Switzerland), triggering seismic waves equivalent to a magnitude 3.1 earthquake. While the 300 residents were evacuated in time, one shepherd was killed and 90% of the village was buried. The event underscores rising alpine hazards linked to permafrost thaw and glacier destabilization, and the need for effective monitoring and early warning systems.
To better understand the dynamics of such events, we conduct research that combines seismic signal analysis, geomorphological observations, and numerical simulations. Since the pioneering work of Kanamori and Brodsky, it has been well established that landslides, including rock, debris, and snow avalanches, generate seismic waves that contain critical information about the source: flow duration, mobilized mass, granular friction, particle impacts on the ground, and interactions with water.
These seismic waves, recorded by dense sensor networks at distances of up to 1000 km depending on landslide volume and frequency content, exhibit a broad spectral range. High-frequency waves are primarily generated by grain-scale flow processes, while long-period waves are linked to the overall accelerations and decelerations of the flow. High-frequency signals are significantly distorted by topography and subsurface heterogeneities, making their interpretation challenging. In contrast, long-period waves are less sensitive to such effects and can be used to retrieve the force exerted by the landslide on the ground through seismic waveform inversion.
This force is obtained by deconvolving the low-frequency seismic signal with the Earth’s Green’s function and provides a means to interpret the mechanical characteristics of the flow. It can be analyzed using physical models ranging from single-block approximations to more advanced granular flow models. However, the inverted force is inherently limited by the bandwidth of the seismic instruments, which may distort its amplitude, duration, and even polarity.
To overcome these limitations, we incorporate additional constraints from independent observations, such as deposit geometry and volumes derived from differential digital elevation models, as well as from numerical simulations, which provide both physical constraints and a means to explore plausible scenarios of the flow dynamics. In this contribution, we introduce the general principles of our combined approach, using the Blatten avalanche as a case study and as an entry point to the more specialized analyses conducted by our research group.}

  abstract = {EN: Slope instabilities take part in weathering and transport processes at the surface. The runout distance is extensively used in 
analysis of landslide dynamics and in the calibration of the rheological parameters involved in numerical modelling. However, the unknown impact
of the uncertainty in the shape of the initial released mass on the runout distance and on the overall shape of the deposit questions the relevance
of these approaches. Indeed, the shape of the initial scar is generally unknown in real cases. Our study is based on numerical simulations coupled 
with remote sensing data analysis. The model used in this study has been intensively compared with laboratory experiments and well constrained natural
cases in order to establish its range of use. We have also developed a pre-event topographic reconstruction method using remote sensing data allowing 
the study of the topographic and initial failure plane geometry effects. We show that the runout distance is a robust parameter that is only poorly
affected by the initial scar geometry. On the contrary, the extent of the deposits perpendicular to the main mass displacement direction is shown 
to be controlled by the scar geometry, providing a unique tool to retrieve information of the initial failure geometry, as well as on the released volume. 
A feedback analysis of Martian landslides shows excellent agreement between numerical results and geomorphological evidence, providing insight into 
the initial landsliding conditions. In addition, we introduce a new empirical dissipation parameter allowing a good prediction of the runout in
the simulation without any calibration for a given geological context.
 FR: Les instabilités gravitaires contribuent aux processus de transport de matière à la surface des planètes et constituent des risques 
importants pour les populations sur Terre. Afin d'apporter des contraintes sur la dynamique des instabilités gravitaires, notre étude se base 
sur le couplage entre simulation numérique et analyse des données par télédétection. Le modèle utilisé s'est montré capable de reproduire des observations
en laboratoire ainsi que la dynamique enregistrée par des signaux sismiques pour un exemple terrestre. En outre, nous avons développé une méthode de 
reconstruction topographique pré-glissement en utilisant les données satellitaires afin d'étudier les effets des conditions initiales. En effet, 
la distance d'arrêt (runout) des dépôts est très largement utilisée dans l'analyse de la dynamique des glissements de terrain ainsi que dans 
la calibration des paramètres rhéologiques impliqués dans la modélisation, et ce malgré les incertitudes sur la géométrie initiale. Nous montrons
par des tests théoriques que le runout est faiblement affecté par la géométrie du plan de rupture. Au contraire, l'extension latérale se révèle être
contrôlée par la géométrie initiale ce qui fourni un cadre unique pour remonter également au volume initial. L'application aux exemples martiens
apporte des contraintes sur les conditions de mise en place et ouvre de nouvelles perspectives pour la compréhension de la dynamique de ces processus. 
En outre, nous introduisons un nouveau paramètre de dissipation empirique indépendant de la topographie permettant, sans calibration, de retrouver par 
la simulation la bonne distance de runout dans un contexte géologique donné.

Abstract ={For the International Forum on Landslide Disaster Management 2007 framework, our team performed several numerical simulations on 
both theoretical and natural cases of granular flows. The objective was to figure out the ability and the limits of our numerical model in 
terms of reproduction and prediction. Our benchmarking exercises show that for almost all the cases, the model we use is able to reproduce 
observations at the field scale. Calibrated friction angles are almost similar to that used in other models and the shape of the final deposits
is in good agreement with observation. However, as it is tricky to compare the dynamics of natural cases, these exercises do not allow us to highlight
the good ability to reproduce the behavior of natural landslides. Nevertheless, by comparing with analytical solution, we show that our model presents
very low numerical dissipation due to the discretization and to the numerical scheme used. Finally, in terms of mitigation and prediction, the different 
friction angles used for each cases figure out the limits of using such model as long as constitutive equations for granular media are not known.}
