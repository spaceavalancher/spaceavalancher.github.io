  abstract  = {With denudation rates locally exceeding one centimetre of fresh marl per year, i.e., more than 250 T.ha−1.yr−1, the badlands 
of the Durance basin in the French Alps makes it one of the world’s most heavily eroding areas. Since 1983, the Draix-Bléone Observatory has 
been using hydro-sedimentary stations to instrument several of these small, unmanaged badland catchments, where the hydrological response 
to seasonal storms is rapid and intense. We combine such chronicles at the outlet of the Laval basin (86 ha) with a six-year diachronic analysis 
of airborne and UAV LiDAR data and a bulk density modelling to map mass movements and constrain a catchment-scale mass balance. We find out that 
landslides and crests failures represents very active areas, accounting for at least 15 % of the sediment budget of the watershed, while affecting 
only 1 % of the bare surfaces. They contribute to making the low drainage areas the places with highest erosion rates, reaching as much as two 
centimetres of fresh marl per year, 3.5 times more than the average value on denuded slopes. Despite some methodological constraints, our approach 
seams very promising at quantifying and localising the erosion hotspots as well as assessing sediment transport through critical zone compartments,
and could be adapted to time series for monitoring the dynamics of badland catchments in a changing climate.},

  abstract = {Slow-moving landslides can cause significant infrastructure damage and casualties,
making their monitoring a critical societal challenge. In the context of climate change
and the projected intensification of rainfall extremes, understanding the response of
slow-moving landslides to extreme meteorological conditions is essential. However,
ground-based surveys are often difficult. In this study, we associate radar
interferometry and optical imagery to investigate the dynamics of a remote tropical
slow-moving landslide on Réunion Island, Grand Eboulis, and its relationship with
precipitation regimes. Our approach enables us to retrieve (1) the bi-monthly dynamics
of the Grand Eboulis landslide from cumulative displacement maps and ground
deformation time series derived from Sentinel-1B images and (2) its multi-annual
dynamics from optical aerial images. Between 2016 and 2021, the landslide moved
eastward and downward at rates of up to 14 cm/yr and 9 cm/yr, respectively.
Displacement was punctuated by periods of accelerated motion following an
exceptionally wet season in mid-2018. In contrast, two slower periods coincided with
the 2018 dry season combined with an exceptionally arid 2019, and with a prolonged
drought in 2020. Additionally, between 2017 and 2019, shallow failures were mapped
only in 2018 at the landslide front and were attributed to Cyclone Dumazile. This study
suggests that slow-moving landslides may respond to seasonal contrasts by
modulating their continuous displacement and to extreme events through shallow
failures. The combined use of InSAR and remote sensed optical imagery proved to be
efficient for studying such a type of events and can easily be widely applicable.},

landslide-generated tsunamis. We use here the HySEA code which incorporates a multilayer structure

by the 2018 seismo-volcanic crisis. The influence of the input parameters and of the model assumptions
is shown to change by a factor 2 the predicted maximum water free surface elevation, velocity and maximum
inundation depth. This demonstrates the need of using numerical models for building local scaling laws 
to relate tsunami and landslide properties. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating high-resolution 
bathymetry, in-depth variations through multilayer modeling and relevant landslide rheology to accurately predict 
tsunami impact. In case of strong topography variations as in Mayotte, using 4 layers seems to be a good compromise
between accuracy and computational cost. Accounting for these effects would enable to refine hazard maps by 
identifying safe and high-risk coastal zones and to improve wave arrival time estimates, thus reducing 
tsunami-related risks in regions like Mayotte.},

 to its intense tropical rainfall regime. Through photogrammetric techniques using historical aerial images, we reconstructed nine DEMs of the entire canyon bed of the 
 ephemeral Rivière des Remparts spanning six decades. Based on differences in DEMs and sediment volume estimates combined with cosmogenic 3 He measurements, we assessed 
 the spatio-temporal evolution of the entire canyon bed and the drainage of products from major landslides and rock avalanches between 1950 and 2011. Results indicate that
  50.2 ± 8.4 Mm 3 (145.5 ± 24.4 Mt) of sediment was transported out of the watershed over 62 years via bed load waves. We modeled the flow dates and showed that such an export
   of material occurred during only 391 days over the 62 years, at an average rate of 0.13 ± 0.02 Mm 3 /day (0.37 ± 0.06 Mt/day). Our investigation confirms that sediment 
   transport coincides with officially recorded extreme meteorological events such as cyclones. Moreover, our findings reveal that sediment transport predominantly occurs 
   on days corresponding to highpercentile rank precipitation events, demonstrating that all transport is concentrated during these intense rainfall periods. Finally, 
   we underscore the extremely fast conveyance of material from slopes to deep-sea fans, facilitated in Réunion by the absence of a coastal platform.},

This is the first time that such an inversion is performed on Earth over an entire image, previous studies having focused on planetary surfaces. 
 This work addresses challenges such as atmospheric and geometrical corrections of these images to produce parameter maps. The use of fast Bayesian 
 inversion significantly reduces computation times thanks to efficient exploration of the parameter space and leads to improved prediction. 
 The parameters of the Hapke model are also interpreted in terms of surface physical properties, thanks to field measurements. 
 Single scattering albedo is the parameter extracted with the greatest reliability, although its validation is still difficult due to the absence of
  a simple formula linking it to surface reflectance. Our study reveals a close relationship between photometric roughness and single scattering albedo,
  indicating that accurate extraction of the former is highly dependent on values of the latter, which must be below 0.8 for reliable estimation. 
   Finally, the correlation between phase function parameters and grain properties depends on surface type and material properties.},

  Tsunamigenic landslides have occurred recently in Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat),

  In this study, we demonstrate how this event started with a glacial thinning–induced

  triggering a 200-meter-high tsunami. Simulations show that the tsunami stabilized 
  into a 7-meter-high long-duration seiche with a frequency (11.45 millihertz) 
  and slow amplitude decay that were nearly identical to the seismic signal. 
  An oscillating, fjord-transverse single force with a maximum amplitude of 5 × 10$^11$
  newtons reproduced the seismic amplitudes and their radiation pattern relative

Our research strongly suggests that the seismic event S1000a may have triggered a significant number of dust avalanches. In contrast, following the seismic event S1222a, there was only a modest increase in avalanche occurrences. Orbital observations of the area surrounding the projected location of the S1222a quake reveal notable topographic features, such as North-South ridges and impact craters. We utilize orbital imagery to evaluate the rate of avalanches and explore how the S1222a event might have influenced this rate. The S1222a event appears to be a plausible factor contributing to the observed increase in avalanches. Our further analysis of the epicenter location aims to clarify how it aligns with the avalanches’ spatial distribution, offering insights into the regional topography.

  abstract = {In May 1965, a main landslide occurred in a deeply incised valley of Piton de la Fournaise volcano, in Réunion Island. This event occurred one day after heavy rainfalls and was consequently interpreted as a mud/debris flow. We take advantage of several sets of historical photographs to reappraise this event. They show that the collapse of a large part of the valley headwall produced a rock flow that dropped 1,740 m and traveled 5,050 m. The surface morphology suggests that the landslide produced a main flow that evolved in a secondary flow in the distal part. The main flow deposit is composed of a matrix-rich fragmented facies and a jigsaw-fracturated facies. The matrix presents a gravely-to-silty granulometry and fractal dimensions ranging between 2.472 and 2.865. Volumes of the collapsed material (59.7 ± 3.1 Mm3) and the deposit (46 ± 13 Mm3) were determined from a photogrammetric approach. We estimated velocities ranging between 86 and 44 m s−1 along the flow path. Our simulations with SHALTOP reveal that the landslide geometry and velocities are well reproduced with frictional Coulomb rheology. We thus interpret the 1965 Mahavel landslide as a main rock avalanche rather than a mud/debris flow. We propose that the trigger of the 1965 avalanche, and of the smaller events in 1995 and 2001, is the water infiltration related to the intense rainfalls, which systematically preceded by one day each collapse. Finally, the succession of dry and wet years before each collapse event could promote favorable conditions to failure.},

The model correctly represents the concentration of suspended sediment during floods, provided that the relation between concentration and water level forms a counterclockwise loop. In the model, the properties of the sediment and of the river are all lumped into four parameters: a settling velocity related to the size of the suspended sediment, a threshold water level which acts as a proxy for the threshold shear stress, a characteristic entrainment rate, and a dimensionless exponent. The value of the parameters changes from one flood to the next, probably reflecting changes in the characteristics of the river and the fine sediment. Finally, a test of the model against data acquired in a small catchment in the French Alps suggests that the model is versatile enough to be used in diverse hydrological settings.},

  abstract = {On the seasonal timescale, for accessible locations and when manpower is available, direct observations and field surveys are the most useful and standard approaches. However very limited studies have been conducted through direct examination on decennial-to-century timescales due to observational constrains. Here, we present an open and reproducible pipeline based on historical aerial images (across a timeline of up to 70 years) that includes sensor calibration, dense matching, and elevation reconstruction in two areas of interest that represent pristine examples of tropical and alpine environments. The Remparts and Langevin rivers, on Réunion Island, and the Bossons glacier, in the French Alps, share limited accessibility (in time and space) that can be overcome only by remote sensing. We reach a metric-to-submetric resolution close to the nominal image spatial sampling. This provides elevation time series with better resolution than most recent satellite images, such as Pleiades, in a decennial time period.},
